   <center><p> This game will allow you to choose your own path!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
  <p  
  style= font-size:200%> The programming is a choose-your-own-path story/game. This game was created through Scratch. The user gets to choose their own bunny character which will then embark on an adventure toward the picnic. The purpose of this game is to let the user choose their own character and their own path.Throughout the story you make your own personalized decisions which can lead your character to 3 different endings.The endings being "Good", "Bad", and "Normal". In addition your character gets to play a fun game in which you can collect food for your friends. This story/game will be entertaining from beggining to end for the user.

     <center><h2>Skills Learned:</h2></center>
      <p style= font-size:200%>  Throughout the development of this project me and my partner encountered multiple obstacles as well as opportunities. A difficulty we encountered was that the text displayed in each scene would not remain only in that scene, but rather continue and pile on with the other text bubbles. For this we had to incorporate coding (which was adding a waiting time for the button) in which the “Next” button would show up until the text bubble time was done. This can be seen on the link provided in this page. This project was my first experience with coding a program; therefore, I learned many new concepts and skills. By creating this story/game I was able to develop skills such as coding logical algorithms, creation of variables, and the process of debugging. These skills are almost vital and the building blocks for all concepts in computer science.   </p>
