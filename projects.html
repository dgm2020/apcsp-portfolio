   <center><p> This game will allow you to choose your own path!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
  <p  
  style= font-size:200%> The programming is a choose-your-own-path story/game. This game was created through Scratch. The user gets to choose their own bunny character which will then embark on an adventure toward the picnic. The purpose of this game is to let the user choose their own character and their own path.Throughout the story you make your own personalized decisions which can lead your character to 3 different endings.The endings being "Good", "Bad", and "Normal". In addition your character gets to play a fun game in which you can collect food for your friends. This story/game will be entertaining from beggining to end for the user. Continue reading for more information about this project.     </p>

     <center><h2>Skills Learned:</h2></center>
      <p style= font-size:200%>  Throughout the development of this project me and my partner encountered multiple obstacles as well as opportunities. A difficulty we encountered was that the text displayed in each scene would not remain only in that scene, but rather continue and pile on with the other text bubbles. For this we had to incorporate coding (which was adding a waiting time for the button) in which the “Next” button would show up until the text bubble time was done. This can be seen on the link provided in this page. This project was my first experience with coding a program; therefore, I learned many new concepts and skills. By creating this story/game I was able to develop skills such as coding logical algorithms, creation of variables, and the process of debugging. These skills are almost vital and the building blocks for all concepts in computer science.   </p>

   <center><p> This game will allow you to gain knowledge of genres and their respective instruments!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
<p  
  style= font-size:200%> The App was created through App Inventor. The purpose of the app is to allow the user to advance in their knowledge of musical instruments and genres. The genres that are incorporated in the App include: Latin, Pop, Rock, and Country. The user can choose from three difficulty levels "Advanced", "Intermediate", and "Beginner". After selecting a desired level the user is presented with multiple images of instruments from which to identify in a certain musical genre. Once the user arrives to a limit of choices, he/she is presented with their scores (correct) and ( missed points). The user is then allowed to continue in the same level or choose another level. This App will provide music enthusiasts with a practical way for learning about instruments!     </p>

      <p style= font-size:200%>  The development of this App introduced my partner and I with multiple obstacles. Although the troubleshooting path was guided through our backlog and user feedback some of the programming was hard to condense to prevent mistakes. A problem we encountered was that the screens would not properly transition. Therefore, I created an accumulator variable (imagechange) which was incorporated into a procedure. The procedure would then analyze the amount of image changes and determine if the screen was ready to transition to the “Soundcheck” screen. I learned multiple concepts and skills from this project including the concept of abstractions which can provide the programmer with ways in which to condense code; yet, can still influence other sets of code. I also received important practice with the use of variables. Both concepts are deeply important for the development of any programming.   </p>

<center><h1 class="a">Project:Capital City Quiz </h1></center>
   <center><p> This game will allow you to gain knowledge of Capitals and their respective States!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
<p  
  style= font-size:200%> The programming language used to create the Capital City Quiz was Python 2.7.10. The purpose of the program is to allow the user to quiz themselves on the capital cities of each of the 50 states. The programming let's the user know if an answer is correct or incorrect. This quiz will succesfully help anyone looking for knowledge of the capital cities of the United States.    </p>

     <center><h2>Skills Learned:</h2></center>
      <p style= font-size:200%>  While developing this code, my partner and I encountered that the coding required multiple repetitions of the same code; therefore, we had to find a way in which we could create a more generalized solution using collections. A skill that we learned was to create generalized solutions, we utilized a dictionary function which allowed for key:value pairs which was exactly what we needed to define our capital:state data and generalize it throughout the programming.  This skill prevented my partner and I from the tedious job of repeating the same code. We received important practice in computing more productive solutions for a code. </p>

      <center><h1 class="a">Project: Simulation</h1></center>
   <center><p> The following project portrays the sifnificant modification that was made to the Wolf Sheep Predation Simulation. </p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
<p  
  style= font-size:200%> A new predator was added to the simulation, a snake, we modified the code by incorporating a new breed (snake) which led to the addition of a new turtle (line) . Also changing the code under “ask wolves” as to have wolves catch both sheep and snakes, not only sheep . Also incorporating a code segment that features the reproduction of snakes and the demand to catch only sheep .In addition, the parameters we added include initial number of snakes ,snake gain from food, and the reproduction of the snakes. Lastly, the  plot was also modified as to include the logistics of the snakes, as originally it only portrayed the population of the sheep,wolves, and amount of grass.

     <center><h2>Skills Learned:</h2></center>
      <p style= font-size:200%>  Modifying the simulation allowed me to learn about predictive power. The modifications made changed the predictive power of the simulation into a stronger tool of simulating a real-life food chain , being that in the real world there are more predators to which sheep fall prey to . The model could be used to make reliable predictions about real world systems under the circumstances of having the simulation include  most of the environmental and biological features known to be present in the habitat of such animals.   </p>

In addition, the dataset provides us with the name of the cause of death , the age-adjusted death rate, and the number of deaths each year for each of the fifty states. The data that we identified and utilized to create the visualization included the  leading causes of death and total number of deaths for the state of California from years 1999 to 2016.

      <p style= font-size:200%>  The knowledge that I gained from my  analysis of the data was that of learning the ten leading causes of death in the past 17 years, in the state in which I reside, California. In addition, I learned that from 1999-2016 ,while heart disease caused the most deaths (1,141,776), suicide caused the least deaths (65,112) in the state of California. The information of the amount of deaths that were caused by many of these illnesses  allowed me to understand the great danger in which people who suffer from such conditions find themselves in.  In addition, I learned how to create a visualization and the benefits which come with being able to easily interpret information. </p>
