   <center><p> This game will allow you to choose your own path!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
  <p  
  style= font-size:200%> The programming is a choose-your-own-path story/game. This game was created through Scratch. The user gets to choose their own bunny character which will then embark on an adventure toward the picnic. The purpose of this game is to let the user choose their own character and their own path.Throughout the story you make your own personalized decisions which can lead your character to 3 different endings.The endings being "Good", "Bad", and "Normal". In addition your character gets to play a fun game in which you can collect food for your friends. This story/game will be entertaining from beggining to end for the user. Continue reading for more information about this project.     </p>

     <center><h2>Skills Learned:</h2></center>
      <p style= font-size:200%>  Throughout the development of this project me and my partner encountered multiple obstacles as well as opportunities. A difficulty we encountered was that the text displayed in each scene would not remain only in that scene, but rather continue and pile on with the other text bubbles. For this we had to incorporate coding (which was adding a waiting time for the button) in which the “Next” button would show up until the text bubble time was done. This can be seen on the link provided in this page. This project was my first experience with coding a program; therefore, I learned many new concepts and skills. By creating this story/game I was able to develop skills such as coding logical algorithms, creation of variables, and the process of debugging. These skills are almost vital and the building blocks for all concepts in computer science.   </p>

 <center><h1 class="a">Project:SoundCheck </h1></center>
   <center><p> This game will allow you to gain knowledge of genres and their respective instruments!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
<p  
  style= font-size:200%> The App was created through App Inventor. The purpose of the app is to allow the user to advance in their knowledge of musical instruments and genres. The genres that are incorporated in the App include: Latin, Pop, Rock, and Country. The user can choose from three difficulty levels "Advanced", "Intermediate", and "Beginner". After selecting a desired level the user is presented with multiple images of instruments from which to identify in a certain musical genre. Once the user arrives to a limit of choices, he/she is presented with their scores (correct) and ( missed points). The user is then allowed to continue in the same level or choose another level. This App will provide music enthusiasts with a practical way for learning about instruments!     </p>

      <p style= font-size:200%>  The development of this App introduced my partner and I with multiple obstacles. Although the troubleshooting path was guided through our backlog and user feedback some of the programming was hard to condense to prevent mistakes. A problem we encountered was that the screens would not properly transition. Therefore, I created an accumulator variable (imagechange) which was incorporated into a procedure. The procedure would then analyze the amount of image changes and determine if the screen was ready to transition to the “Soundcheck” screen. I learned multiple concepts and skills from this project including the concept of abstractions which can provide the programmer with ways in which to condense code; yet, can still influence other sets of code. I also received important practice with the use of variables. Both concepts are deeply important for the development of any programming.   </p>

<center><h1 class="a">Project:Capital City Quiz </h1></center>
   <center><p> This game will allow you to gain knowledge of Capitals and their respective States!</p></center> 
    <center><h2>Description:</h2></center>
<p  
  style= font-size:200%> The programming language used to create the Capital City Quiz was Python 2.7.10. The purpose of the program is to allow the user to quiz themselves on the capital cities of each of the 50 states. The programming let's the user know if an answer is correct or incorrect. This quiz will succesfully help anyone looking for knowledge of the capital cities of the United States.    </p>

     <center><h2>Skills Learned:</h2></center>
      <p style= font-size:200%>  While developing this code, my partner and I encountered that the coding required multiple repetitions of the same code; therefore, we had to find a way in which we could create a more generalized solution using collections. A skill that we learned was to create generalized solutions, we utilized a dictionary function which allowed for key:value pairs which was exactly what we needed to define our capital:state data and generalize it throughout the programming.  This skill prevented my partner and I from the tedious job of repeating the same code. We received important practice in computing more productive solutions for a code. </p>
