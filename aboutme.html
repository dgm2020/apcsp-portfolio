      <center><h1 style= background-color:magenta> About Me... </h1></center>
   
   
    <center><h2 class="a" style= "color:magenta"> I am Diana Gandara and 16 years old, and a student at Don Lugo High School. 
    I am part of the LEAD academy which focuses on engineering. 
    Also, I am currently taking 4 AP classes and involved in 3 clubs (Spanish, Class of 2020, and Key Club) at school. 
    I am an officer in each of those clubs.
    I want to attend a UC school, but I am still undecided on what I want to major in.Some of my personal life is that I have 3 sisters, and a niece and nephew. My closest friends and BFF also attend this school which is a blessing because they are always there for me.  </h2></center>
