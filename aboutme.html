   <p style= "color:royalblue"> I am  16 years old, and a student at Don Lugo High School. 
    I am part of the LEAD academy which focuses on engineering. 
    Also, I am currently taking 4 AP classes and involved in 3 clubs (Spanish, Class of 2020, and Key Club) at school. 
    I am an officer in each of those clubs.
    I want to attend a UC school, but I am still undecided on what I want to major in. </p>
